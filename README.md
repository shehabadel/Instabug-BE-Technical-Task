# Instabug-BE-Technical-Task
Instabug Backend Internship Summer 2022 Technical Task

***Received my rejection letter in 06/06/2022. Sad, but atleast we are one rejection closer to an offer!***

It consists of six MySQL questions where we had to run POST requests on their API endpoint
to execute the problems' queries and submit the solution.

## My comments

Regarding this experience, I enjoyed it kind of. Yet it could have been better if it they have mentioned earlier some details like we could have submitted queries once more, and that Killing query issue is not a big deal.
